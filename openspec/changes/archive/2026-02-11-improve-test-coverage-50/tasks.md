## 1. Coverage Baseline

- [x] 1.1 Record current coverage output and module-level gaps
- [x] 1.2 Identify top 3 modules to prioritize for new tests

## 2. Add Tests for High-Impact Modules

- [x] 2.1 Add tests for `hardware.psm1` using mocks for system probes
- [x] 2.2 Add tests for `win.psm1` and `wrapper.psm1` with mockable dependencies

## 3. Deepen Existing Coverage

- [x] 3.1 Expand tests for `install.psm1` beyond module detection
- [x] 3.2 Expand tests for `functions.psm1` edge cases and error paths

## 4. Verify Coverage Target

- [x] 4.1 Run coverage and confirm >=50%
- [x] 4.2 Document any remaining low-coverage modules and follow-up items
