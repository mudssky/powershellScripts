  // Place your snippets for json here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Create a snippet": {
    "prefix": "sn",
    "description": "Create a snippet for VSCode",
    "body": [
      "{",
      "\t\"$1\": {",
      "\t\t\"prefix\": \"$2\",",
      "\t\t\"description\": \"$3\",",
      "\t\t\"body\": [",
      "\t\t\t$4",
      "\t\t]",
      "\t}",
      "}"
    ]
  }
}
